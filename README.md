Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study This repository contains the complete analysis for the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project. The goal was to analyze 12 months of historical trip data to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

Tools Used:

SQL (BigQuery): For data warehousing, cleaning, and merging 5.7 million rows of data.

R: For statistical validation and exploratory analysis.

Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing usage trends.

Key Insight: Casual riders primarily use the service for weekend leisure, while members use it for weekday commuting. This project proposes three data-driven recommendations to target the casual segment.
